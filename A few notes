everything to downcase
languages = array with only one language per object
provided services = array with only one service per object
gender = array with only one gender per object
age = hash ex{minimum_age: 3443, maximum_age: 3443}
phone_number = hash ex {main: 232, fax: 3434, emergency: 2443}


Looking at the data, I think we may need to create a separate object for the fee info. Initially... well you can see what I thought initially, but I think we can break it into a few categories: No Fee, Sliding Scale, and Paid Services.

Similarly, I'm a bit concerned about how to do the 'provided services'.  If need be it doesn't have to be fully searchable, but I think we should try to get each of the provided services into one of the categories we had earlier. I bet if we both thought about it we could come up with some algorithmic solution, but It'll defintiely be tricky.
